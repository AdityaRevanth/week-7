    <h1>VALORANT</h1>
    <h3>Valorant is a popular tactical first-person shooter (FPS) game developed by Riot Games, released in 2020. It's known for its emphasis on team-based gameplay, where players choose characters known as "agents," each with unique abilities that contribute to their team's strategy. The game combines precise gunplay mechanics similar to Counter-Strike with the character abilities seen in games like Overwatch.

        Valorant revolves around 5v5 matches where one team defends bomb sites while the other attempts to plant a bomb. The attacking team wins if they successfully detonate the bomb or eliminate the opposing team. On the other hand, the defending team can win by either defusing the bomb or eliminating the attackers.
        
        Its strategic elements include careful planning, coordination, and leveraging the specific abilities of each agent. Riot Games regularly introduces new agents, maps, and updates to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging for its player base. Additionally, it has a competitive mode that allows players to climb ranks and compete in ranked matches to test their skills against others.
        
        Valorant has gained a substantial following in the esports community, with tournaments and professional leagues showcasing high-level gameplay and strategies. Its blend of precise shooting mechanics and diverse agent abilities has contributed to its popularity among FPS enthusiasts.
